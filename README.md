# rainbow-project-ozberry
A demo project to show a rainbow sequence with the Raspberry PI

During the demo we showed the following:

1. Creating a new project within Github (adding a name and description)
2. Cloning the project to a personal computer using the `git clone REPO_GOES_HERE` command line method (available to all common operating systems, Linux, MacOS, Windows).
3. Including project files into the working folder (Example being that you have a project you want to migrate to Github)
4. Adding the files to github (`git add .` then `git commit -m 'added rainbow.py file'` then `git push origin main`)
5. Which then Darryl could pull the files down from Github onto his Raspberry Pi and run the program (`git clone REPO_GOES_HERE` then `git pull origin main`)
6. A last example, showed how to update the file added, where some changes were made to a file. Github is then able to detect the new changes from the old. (`git add . ` then `git commit -m 'reduced the timer speed and increased the brightness'` then `git push origin main` - were the commands used)

The slides are included within this repo alongside the source code used. Happy coding!
